Incident Report: Authentication Token Reuse

Summary

This incident involved multiple users submitting GET requests with identical authentication tokens, leading to unauthorized access to accounts. The issue affected the login services and resulted in improper session management. The resolution required code fixes and a database reboot to clear residual authentication tokens.

Detection

The incident was discovered through the system logs, which showed that different users were submitting GET requests using the same authentication tokens. Additionally, a significant number of users were attempting to log in repeatedly, raising alerts. These patterns were detected during routine monitoring.

Impact

The incident impacted the login services, causing user sessions to be improperly managed. Users experienced issues logging into their accounts, and in some cases, unauthorized access to accounts occurred due to shared authentication tokens. The business impact was moderate, as it disrupted user activity and created potential security concerns.

Timeline

9:00 AM: The issue began, with users submitting requests using identical authentication tokens.

9:15 AM: On-call staff were alerted to the abnormal patterns in the logs.

6:00 PM: The issue was identified after on-call staff completed their classes and work commitments, during which time detailed analysis was conducted.

Root Cause

The root cause was identified as a combination of two factors. First, the code allowed authentication tokens to persist even after users logged out, resulting in tokens being reused. Second, the database was retaining these tokens, likely due to improper clearing of session data upon user logout. This combination led to the observed issues with session handling and token reuse.

Resolution

The resolution involved two key steps. First, the code was updated to ensure that authentication tokens are properly cleared from the database when users log out. This included modifying the clearAuth function and ensuring alignment with the databaseâ€™s logoutUser method. Second, the database was rebooted to clear any residual tokens that were incorrectly stored. These actions resolved the issue and restored normal operation to the login services.

Prevention

To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures have been implemented:

Enhanced monitoring and alerting systems to detect token reuse earlier.

Additional logging to capture detailed session data for improved analysis.

Regular code reviews to ensure session handling best practices are followed.

Scheduled database maintenance to ensure residual tokens are not retained.

Action Items

Conduct a postmortem analysis with the development and operations teams to review the incident in detail and identify further preventive measures.

Implement automated tests to validate proper token clearing during the logout process.

Schedule a training session for the team to improve familiarity with secure session management practices.

Review and optimize database procedures related to session management to ensure scalability and reliability.

This incident highlighted the importance of robust session management and the need for proactive monitoring and response systems to maintain service reliability.
